# Michael's API Endpoint

## Contributors
Michael Levy 

## Usage
This API endpoint stores and parses data from a Light Weight Communications and Marshalling file for mbot runs. Data can be viewed and
sorted on [mbot.mplevy.com](https://mbot.mplevy.com/) and initial work can be seen on [robotics.mplevy.com](https://robotics.mplevy.com/). 

## How to use
Checkout [api.mplevy.com/api.com](https://api.mplevy.com/api/) to try out using this endpoint with swagger. If you need custom analysis python scripts this [analysis file](https://github.com/levymp/MBOT/blob/feature-documentation-app/documentation/analysis_utils.py) will handle all tasks related to this endpoint.

## Motivation
During my work on mobile robotics (see [MBOT](https://github.com/levymp/MBOT) and [MBOT-RPI](https://github.com/levymp/MBOT-RPI)) I decided to make a database in order to store and analyze data during testing. This database will be used for all storage and parsing of
data from the mbot robot.

## What I did
This database was written all in flask and utilized swagger for all documentation.
